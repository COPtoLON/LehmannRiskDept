## Notes
To effectively collaborate, we need both a strong research/analysis process and a robust development/implementation pipeline. So far, we have:
  - [x] Build a shared OneNote - [Shared OneNote](https://1drv.ms/o/s!AgNEZJcB63U7hvoeLgN6gnu_aKbdrg?e=ZxdFYK)
  - [x] Build a shared GitHub Repo - [Github Repo](https://github.com/COPtoLON/LehmannRiskDept)
  - [x] Build a shared IMC Island - [Dashboard - LehmannBrosRiskDep](https://prosperity.imc.com/dashboard)
  - [ ] Build a shared database
  - [ ] Build a shared codespace

Below is a summary of the tasks we should tackle next:

1. Review Competitors and Past Strategies
   We’re waiting on Saeid’s list of previous (and possibly current) competitors. Once received, we should all go through it—taking notes on key strategies from previous rounds—then discuss our findings and any potential new angles we can develop.

2. Locate and Organize Relevant Data
   We need to find data from past competitions (or from other relevant challenges) for backtesting and analysis. Any discovered datasets should be uploaded to the LehmannRiskDept/RESOURCES folder, while the raw data files go into LehmannRiskDept/DATA. These resources will be critical for validation and experimentation.

3. Brainstorm Strategy Ideas
   We should focus on possible solutions for each round. There are five rounds, potentially scrambled in order and featuring a stable product along with a range of additional products. By noting what we already know from past competitions, we can hypothesize likely scenarios and develop strategies accordingly.

4. Capture and Share All Insights
   Any new idea—whether a complete strategy or a minor improvement—should go into an “Ideas – [Name]” entry. This ensures each concept is documented, so we can build on them over time.

If everyone can contribute to these steps, we’ll be well on our way to a more organized, efficient research and development process.
