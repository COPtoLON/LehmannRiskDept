## Notes


### Problems
1. Find relevant data from previous years (or relevant challenges)
  - Find relevant data files from previous years in the list of relevant partners
  - Upload the relevant data into the LehmannRiskDept/DATA folder 
2. Find relevant problems(+ solutions?) from previous years (or relevant challenges)
  - Upload these to the LehmannRiskDept/RESOURCES folder 
3. What do we know about the challenge?
  - How long are the rounds?
  - There are 5 rounds
  - The rounds may look alike from past years, but can be scrambled together, the order is inconsistent
  - In general there may be a stable product and a range of other products
4. Build a proper Research/Analysis, Development and implementation pipeline.
  - Build a shared OneNote
  - [x] Build a shared GitHub Repo
