### Proposition 1. We need to go through Saeid's list of previous competitors (& Perhaps also current competitors)
We all need to read through Saeid's List of previous competitors (& perhaps also current competitors)
We need to go through this [list - waiting for Saeid]().To read up on previous strategies for each round, make our own notes and talk about them. \
2. Find relevant problems(+ solutions?) from previous years (or relevant challenges)
  - Upload these to the LehmannRiskDept/RESOURCES folder 

### Proposition 2. We need to get a hold of relevant data
We need to find previous years datasets or other relevant datasets to backtest against.
1. Find relevant data from previous years (or relevant challenges)
  - Find relevant data files from previous years in the list of relevant partners
  - Upload the relevant data into the LehmannRiskDept/DATA folder 

### Proposition 3. We need to find our ideas for strategies to run in each round
We need to build ideas on how to best solve the challenges for each round.
3. What do we know about the challenge?
  - How long are the rounds?
  - There are 5 rounds
  - The rounds may look alike from past years, but can be scrambled together, the order is inconsistent
  - In general there may be a stable product and a range of other products

### Proposition 4. 
Note down everything and anything you find relevant in each of the "Ideas - Name".
If any of us comes up with something novel, something that works or just any tiny idea to improve on already good ideas, we will move ahead.
